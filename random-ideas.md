# Random ideas for CPS that popped into my head

- A polygon, that increases your stats the more you walk (so you have to non-stop walk if you want to have good collection)
- A super-attack bar just above coin's health, that if timed out nearly perfectly, increases temporarily your attack. It stacks, and the streak ends when you mess up the timing.
