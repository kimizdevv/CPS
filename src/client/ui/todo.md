# CPS UI

- ~~handle coin ui on the client; the game will be much more stable with this approach.~~
- currency ui (coins and emeralds)
- shop ui
- skill tree ui
- level bar? (a small and resizable one in the corner)
  - skill tree unlocks at lvl 10
- settings/credits ui
- buffs view ui (full right screen side, starting from the bottom corner)

## OTHER

- collectible ui:
  - damage indicators
    - greyed out when someone else damages the collectible
    - the more significant the damage was, the bigger the indicator
- collectible focus mode? (camera points straight at the collectible)
